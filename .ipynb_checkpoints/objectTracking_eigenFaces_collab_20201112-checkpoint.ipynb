    "# Tips on running this notebook:\n",
    "In theory it would be nice if you could just enter the path of the video(s) and just let it run all the way through. In practice, there are a few hoops to jump through\n",
    "- Run the import cell block (two blocks below this one). This should pretty much always be done, even if you are loading precomputed file from disk instead of calculating them. This step loads in some useful meta data used throughout.\n",
    "- Use the Save and Load cell blocks to save and load data after long calculations. It seriously helps with iterating, debugging, and memory allocation.\n",
    "    - These arrays can be BIG. I regularly go past 128 GB when running my data through. It's often easiest to just restart the kernel, load in just the precomputed variables needed and run the script in the middle (skipping all the previous computations)\n",
    "- There are two cell blocks for calculating the optic flow (parameters set independently as well), one single-threaded and one multi-threaded. Do parameter tuning on the single-threaded one so you can quit out of it, as well as watch the calculation as it happens with showVideo_pref=1. The multi-threaded one is only faster if you have a lot of cores in your CPU (>10), then it's faster, else stick with the single-threaded version and set showVideo_pref=0.\n",
    "- Parameter tuning should be pretty easy. Most of the cell blocks can be halted in the middle of computation so you can just look at a small bit of the data, tune a parameter and then rerun the code\n",
    "\n",
    "### The most important parameters:  \n",
    "***(Consider all of these before you run the code for the first time)***\n",
    "- Optic flow params:\n",
    "    - **'spacing'**: ~ 3 to 12. Spacing between dots, in pixels. Inversely related to number of dots to use in the calculation. Try to keep the number of dots below 2000 if possible (eats up memory and computation time). More dots generally means better final results, more robust to outliers and weird stuff. I'd make the spacing as small (more dots) as you can go before you run out of RAM in the final calculations\n",
    "    - **lk_params 'win_size'**: ~ 25,25 to 80,80. This is the spatial integration window for the optical flow measurement. Try to make it as small as possible without it becoming unstable. The two values are for X and Y length of square integration window. Probably keep the same for most applications\n",
    "- Outlier removal params:\n",
    "    - **outlier_threshold_positions**: ~ 20 to 100. If a dot strays more than this many pixels away from its anchor position, its displacement in the dimension it cross the threshold in, for those time points (and some time points around it, see params below), for that dot only, will be set to zero\n",
    "    - **outlier_threshold_displacements** ~ 5 to 25. Similar to above, but for displacement. Only the outlier time points are removed (no window around outliers considered).\n",
    "    - **framesHalted_beforeOutlier**: ~ 0 to 30. The number of frames to also remove before detected outlier events. Consider what is causing your outlier event. If it is an arm movement or something, how long does such a movement last? How long before it will cause a dot to move to the outlier threshold?\n",
    "    - **framesHalted_afterOutlier**: ~ 0 to 10. Simlar to above but for after an outlier event is detected\n",
    "    - **relaxation_factor** : ~ 0.03 to 0.1. This is the rate of the exponential decay / relaxation / attraction back to the anchor position that a point undergoes. It is meant to prevent baseline drift. Think of it like a high pass on the dot position trace\n",
    "- Spectral analysis params:\n",
    "    - **win_len**: ~ 0.1 to 1.0. The length of the time window used for the short-time Fourier transform. Longer gives better spectral resolution, shorter gives better temporal resolution. There are several other parameters that are related but this is the most important. Longer windows (along with decreasing the overlap parameter) also decrease the size of the output spectrograms, which can help with memory and computation time in the subsequent analyses\n",
    "- TCA:\n",
    "    - **rank = 6**: ~ 2 to 10. The number of factors to look for in the PARAFAC model. More can be good but less reproduceable, but less can mix together obviously different factors\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals for improving code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the code is slowest:\n",
    "- Calculating the optic flow displacement field: ~30 min\n",
    "    - There are now two cell blocks, one that doesn't use multiprocessing, and one that does. The multiprocessing one is about twice as fast on my machine (36 cores), but might not be on rigs with fewer cores. OpenCV's lucas-kanande algorithm has some multiprocessing built in which is why improvement is sublinear\n",
    "- The tensor decomposition. Tensorly is great and even uses ML packages as backends (torch, tf, etc), but it seems far from optimal. It runs fast on a GPU, but minibatching isn't implemented so that caps the maximum size of the data you can put in. Improvements could come from the following:\n",
    "    - Building an optimal training set (ie subsampling time points where informative things are happening)\n",
    "    - Iterative training by initializing with learned weights before training on new data (aka janky minibatching)\n",
    "- Spectral analysis. This one is not as slow as the above, and is already semi optimized, but if you think one of the JIT, precompilation, or accelerator methods is appropriate here, it could help (numba, jax, pypy, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural improvements to be made:\n",
    "- Outlier handling. It's a bit basic right now. I'm not sure what a better model would look like, but I'm open to suggestions. One issue is that pausing pixels (or canceling either the x or y velocities) results in correlated variance of an artefact (the grooming event or just poor displacement calculation). Devaluing those points at those samples could help model fitting.\n",
    "- Spectral analysis. This problem is well suited for multi-resolution analysis. I got a continuous wavelet transform working well with continuous morlet wavelets, but it would probably be smarter to use a discrete wavelet transform with an orthogonal wavelet.\n",
    "- Calculate in color. Currently I convert every frame to greyscale. Color holds information that could be usefull\n",
    "- Improved displacement field calculation:\n",
    "    - Use a fancier method. There are better ones out there that integrate image gnostic information. Standard image tracking models usually don't work so well, but a decent mixed model could be perfect here\n",
    "    - A very simple mixed model we could implement: Build a kalman filter like inference model using an observation model (something super simple like a translation offset calculated from cross correlating a small window with the region arround; basically motion correction), and a kinematic model (from the optic flow).\n",
    "- OpenCV really isn't used that much anymore in this code. It's just used for metadata gathering. Should be removed since opencv can be weird to install sometimes\n",
    "    \n",
    "Simple UI improvements:\n",
    "- Notice that there are cell blocks for saving and loading. These are pretty jank. Not sure how to best to improve.\n",
    "- Never figured out how to save Tensorly tensor objects. Would be nice not to have to convert the output kruskal tensor as numpy file, and would be nice to be able to save the input dense tensor to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packaging:\n",
    "This analysis will be useful primarily by people with very little computational skill. So effort must be made to minimize boilerplate\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "- Moonshot:\n",
    "    - Zero programming skill required. End-user opens an .exe file on their windows machine and a GUI pops up that just works. (PyInstaller)\n",
    "- Reach:\n",
    "    - Install Anaconda, pip install this package, python -m this package, GUI pops up and you're good to go\n",
    "- Par:\n",
    "    - A well functionalized package with tunable parameters; a pip install\n",
    "- Fine:\n",
    "    - A few well commented jupyter notebooks\n",
